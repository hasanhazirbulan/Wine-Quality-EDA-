# 🍷 Wine Quality EDA

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the popular **Wine Quality Dataset** to understand the relationships between chemical properties of wine and its quality rating.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes physicochemical properties of red or white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.

Each record contains features like:
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- **Quality** (target variable)

## 📊 Project Goals

- Get a general understanding of the dataset
- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis
- Explore correlations between variables
- Investigate which features might be good predictors of wine quality
- Visualize findings using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📌 Key Findings

- Alcohol has a strong positive correlation with wine quality.
- Volatile acidity is negatively correlated with quality.
- Most wines in the dataset have a quality rating between 5 and 6.
